      CampusEase is a platform created by college students to simplify event planning. We help students find the vendors, transport, and aesthetic supplies they need to make their events memorable and stress-free.Born out of late-night brainstorms, chaotic deadlines, and endless group calls, CampusEase is the solution we wish we had when we first started organizing college events. We understand the excitement of your first freshers' party, the stress of college fests, and the chaos of managing vendors, budgets, and design ideas â€” all while balancing classes and exams.We created CampusEase not just as a platform, but as a companion. Whether youâ€™re managing a cultural fest, setting up a technical conclave, or planning a themed farewell, our aim is to make the process easier, smarter, and more beautiful.

    <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Our Story</h1>
    <p class="text-center mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
    We started CampusEase with one simple mission â€” to make college event planning less chaotic and more enjoyable. Like most students, we struggled to find reliable vendors, aesthetic decoration ideas, and transportation solutions. So instead of waiting for a better system, we built one.We started CampusEase as a side project during a particularly hectic college festival. With five events running in parallel, sourcing vendors, getting approvals, and setting up decor felt nearly impossible â€” and thatâ€™s when the idea sparked. CampusEase was developed entirely by students from VIT Pune who understand how real and chaotic event management can be â€” especially when youâ€™re juggling submissions and assignments at the same time.</p>
